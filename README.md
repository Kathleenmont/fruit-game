# Fruit Addition Game

This Project is a JavaScript fruit addition game. This is a mobile friendly math game users can use to keep their math skills sharp 

GETTING STARTED
Click the fruit to get points. If your Point Total matches the Target Number, you win the round! If your Point Total goes over the Target Number you lose the round. 

Each fruit is worth a different number of points. Each round the Target number changes and so does the value of each fruit.
